[ 
.I options

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B tek2plot 
translates Tektronix graphics files to other formats, or displays
them on an X Window System display.
The output format is specified with the 
.BR \-T " option."
The possible output formats are the same as those 
supported by
.BR graph (1),
.BR plot (1),
.BR pic2plot (1),
and
.BR plotfont (1).
If an output file is produced, it is written to standard output.
.LP
Options and file names may be interspersed on the command line, but
the options are processed before the file names are read.
If 
.B \-\- 
is seen, it is interpreted as the end of the options.
If no file names are specified, or the file name 
.B \- 
is encountered, the standard input is read.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS General Options
.TP
.BI \-T " type"
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI \-\-output\-format " type"
Select 
.I type
as the output format.
It may be "X", "png", "pnm", "gif", "svg", "ai", "ps", "cgm", "fig",
"pcl", "hpgl", "regis", "tek", or "meta" (the default).
These refer respectively
to the X Window System,
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format,
portable anymap format (PBM/PGM/PPM), 
a pseudo-GIF format that
does not use LZW encoding,
the new XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format,
the format used by Adobe Illustrator, Postscript or
Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) that can be edited with
.BR idraw (1),
CGM format (by default, confirming to the WebCGM profile),
the format used by the 
.BR xfig (1) 
drawing editor, the Hewlett\-Packard PCL 5 printer
language, the Hewlett\-Packard Graphics Language, 
ReGIS graphics format (which can be displayed 
by the
.BR dxterm (1)
terminal emulator or by a VT330 or VT340 terminal),
Tektronix format itself,
and device-independent GNU metafile format.
Unless \fItype\fP\^ is "X", an output file is produced and written
to standard output.
.IP ""
Omitting the 
.B \-T
option is equivalent to specifying
.BR "\-T meta" .
GNU metafile format may be translated to other formats with
.BR plot (1).
.TP
.BI \-p " n"
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI \-\-page\-number " n"
Output only page number 
.IR n ,
within the
Tektronix file or sequence of Tektronix files that is being translated.
\fIn\fP\^ must
be a non-negative integer, since a Tektronix file may consist of one 
or more pages, numbered beginning with zero.
.IP ""
The default behavior if the 
.B \-p 
option is not used is to output
all nonempty pages in succession.
For example, 
.B tek2plot \-T X
displays each Tektronix page in its own X window.
If the 
.BR "\-T png" ,
.BR "\-T pnm" ,
.BR "\-T gif" ,
.BR "\-T ai" ,
or
.B \-T fig
option is used, the default behavior is to output only the first nonempty
Tektronix page, since files in those output formats contain only a single
page of graphics.
.IP ""
Most Tektronix files consist of either one page (page #0) or two
pages (an empty page #0, and page #1).
Tektronix files produced by the GNU plotting utilities (e.g., by 
.BR "graph \-T tek" )
are normally of the latter sort.
.TP
.BI \-F " name"
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI \-\-font\-name " name"
Use the font \fIname\fP\^ for rendering the native Textronix fonts,
if it is available.
The default font is "Courier" except for 
.BR "tek2plot \-T png" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T pnm" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T gif" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T hpgl" , 
.BR "tek2plot \-T regis" , 
and
.BR "tek2plot \-T tek" , 
for which it is "HersheySerif".
A list of available fonts can be obtained with the
.B \-\-help\-fonts
option (see below).
If a font outside the Courier family is used, the 
.B \-\-position\-chars
option (see below) should probably be specified.
.IP ""
The
.B \-F
option is useful only if you have a Tektronix file
that draws text using native Tektronix fonts.
Tektronix files produced by the GNU plotting utilities (e.g., by 
.BR "graph \-T tek" )
do not use native Tektronix fonts: they use Hershey vector fonts instead.
.TP
.BI \-W " line_width"
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI \-\-line\-width " line_width"
Set the width of lines, as a fraction of
the width of the display, to be
.IR line_width .
A negative value means that a default value should be used.
This value is format-dependent.
The interpretation of zero line width is also
format-dependent (in some output formats, a zero-width line is the thinnest
line that can be drawn; in others, a zero-width line is invisible).
.TP
.BI \-\-bg\-color " name"
Set the color used for the background to be 
.IR name .
This is relevant only to 
.BR "tek2plot \-T X" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T png" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T pnm" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T gif" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T svg" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T cgm" ,
and
.BR "tek2plot \-T regis" .
An unrecognized name sets the color to the default, which is "white".
The environment variable
.SB BG_COLOR
can equally well be used to specify the background color.
If the 
.B \-T svg
or
.B \-T cgm
option is used, an output file without a background may be produced
by setting the background color to "none".
.IP ""
If the 
.B \-T png
or
.B \-T gif
option is used, a transparent PNG file
or a transparent pseudo-GIF, respectively, may be produced by
setting the 
.SB TRANSPARENT_COLOR
environment variable to the name of the background color.
.TP
.BI \-\-bitmap\-size " bitmap_size"
Set the size of the graphics display in which the plot will be drawn,
in terms of pixels, to be
.IR bitmap_size .
The default is "570x570".
This is relevant only to 
.BR "plot \-T X" , 
.BR "plot \-T png" , 
.BR "plot \-T pnm" , 
and
.BR "plot \-T gif" .
If you choose a rectangular (non-square) window size, the fonts in the 
plot will be scaled anisotropically, i.e., by different factors in the 
horizontal and vertical directions.
For 
.BR "plot \-T X" , 
this requires an X11R6 display.
Any font that cannot be scaled in this way will be replaced by a default
scalable font, such as the vector font "HersheySerif".
.IP ""
The environment variable 
.SB BITMAPSIZE
can equally well be used to
specify the window size.
For backward compatibility, the
X resource 
.B Xplot.geometry
may be used instead.
.TP
.BI \-\-emulate\-color " option"
If 
.I option
is 
.IR yes ,
replace each color in the output by an appropriate shade of gray.
This is seldom useful, except when using `
.B tek2plot -T pcl
to prepare output for a PCL 5 device.
(Many monochrome PCL 5 devices, such as monochrome
LaserJets, do a poor job of emulating color on their own.)
You may equally well request color emulation by setting the environment
variable
.SB EMULATE_COLOR
to "yes".
.TP
.BI \-\-max\-line\-length " max_line_length"
Set the maximum number of points that a
polygonal line may contain, before it is flushed out, to be 
.IR max_line_length .
If this flushing occurs, the polygonal line will be split into two or more
sub-lines, though the splitting should not be noticeable.
The default value of \fImax_line_length\fP\^ is 500.
.IP ""
The reason for splitting long polygonal lines is that some display devices
(e.g., old Postscript printers and HP-GL pen plotters) have
limited buffer sizes.
The environment variable 
.SB MAX_LINE_LENGTH
can also be used to specify the maximum line length.
.TP
.BI \-\-page\-size " pagesize"
Set the size of the page on which the plot will be positioned.
This is relevant only to
.BR "tek2plot \-T svg" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T ai" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T ps" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T cgm" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T fig" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T pcl" ,
and
.BR "tek2plot \-T hpgl" .
The default is "letter", which means an 8.5 inch by 11 inch page.
Any ISO page size in the range "a0".\|.\|."a4" or ANSI page size in the
range "a".\|.\|."e" may be specified ("letter" is an alias for "a" and
"tabloid" is an alias for "b").
"legal" and "ledger" are recognized page sizes also.
The environment variable
.SB PAGESIZE 
can equally well be used to specify the page size.
.IP ""
The graphics display in which the plot is drawn will be a square region
that would occupy nearly the full width of the specified page.
An alternative size for the graphics display can be specified.
For example, the page size could be specified as
"letter,xsize=4in,ysize=6in", or "a4,xsize=5.0cm,ysize=100mm".
For all of the above except
.BR "tek2plot \-T hpgl" , 
the graphics display will, by default, be centered on the page.
For all of the above except
.B "tek2plot \-T svg"
and
.BR "tek2plot \-T cgm" ,
the graphics display may be repositioned manually, by specifying the
location of its lower left corner, relative to the lower left corner of the
page.
For example, the page size could be specified as
"letter,xorigin=2in,yorigin=3in", or "a4,xorigin=0.5cm,yorigin=0.5cm".
It is also possible to specify an offset vector.
For example, the page size could be specified as "letter,xoffset=1in",
or "letter,xoffset=1in,yoffset=1.2in", or "a4,yoffset=\-1cm".
In SVG format and WebCGM format it is possible to specify the size
of the graphics display, but not its position.
.TP
.BI \-\-pen\-color " name"
Set the pen color to be 
.IR name .
An unrecognized name sets the pen color to the default, which is "black".
.TP
.B \-\-position\-chars
Position the characters in each text string individually.
If the text font is not a member of the Courier family,
and especially if it is not a fixed-width font, this option is
recommended.
It will improve the appearance of text strings, at
the price of making it difficult to edit the output file with
.BR xfig (1),
.BR idraw (1),
or Illustrator.
.TP
.BI \-\-rotation " angle"
Rotate the graphics display by
.IR angle " degrees."
Recognized values are "0", "90", "180", and "270".
"no" and "yes" are equivalent to "0" and "90", respectively.
The environment variable 
.SB ROTATION
can also be used to specify a rotation angle.
.TP
.B \-\-use\-tek\-fonts
Use the bitmap fonts that were used on the original Tektronix
4010/4014 terminal.
This option is relevant only to
.BR "tek2plot \-T X" .
The four relevant bitmap fonts are distributed with most
versions of the GNU plotting utilities, under the names
"tekfont0".\|.\|."tekfont3".
They can easily be installed on any modern X Window System display.
For this option to work properly,
you must also select a window size of 
.if t 1024\(mu1024
.if n 1024x1024
pixels, either by
using the 
.B \-\-bitmap\-size 1024x1024
option or by setting the value
of the 
.B Xplot.geometry
resource.
This is because bitmap fonts, unlike the scalable fonts that
.B tek2plot
normally uses, cannot be rescaled.
.IP ""
This option is useful only if you have a file in Tektronix format
that draws text using native Tektronix fonts.
Tektronix files produced by the GNU plotting utilities (e.g., by 
.BR "graph \-T tek" )
do not use native Tektronix fonts: they use Hershey vector fonts instead.
.SS Options for Metafile Output
.LP
The following option is relevant only if the
.B \-T
option is omitted or if 
.B "\-T meta"
is used.
In this case 
.B tek2plot
outputs a GNU graphics metafile,
which must be translated to other formats with
.BR plot (1).
.TP
.B \-O
.br
.ns
.TP
.B \-\-portable\-output
Output the portable (human-readable) version of GNU metafile
format, rather than a binary version (the default).
The format of the binary version is machine-dependent.
.SS Informational Options
.TP 
.B \-\-help
Print a list of command-line options, and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-help\-fonts
Print a table of available fonts, and exit.
The table will depend on which output format
is specified with
the 
.B \-T 
option.
.BR "tek2plot \-T X" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T svg" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T ai" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T ps" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T cgm" ,
and 
.B tek2plot \-T fig
each support the 35 standard Postscript fonts.
.BR "tek2plot \-T svg" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T pcl" ,
and 
.B tek2plot \-T hpgl
support the 45 standard PCL 5 fonts, and the latter two support
a number of Hewlett\-Packard vector fonts.
All seven support a set of 22 Hershey vector fonts, as do
.BR "tek2plot \-T png" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T pnm" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T gif" ,
.BR "tek2plot \-T regis" ,
and
.BR "tek2plot \-T tek" .
.B tek2plot
without a
.B \-T
option in principle
supports any of these fonts, since its output must be translated
to other formats with
.BR plot (1).
.IP ""
The
.BR plotfont (1)
utility may be used to obtain a character map of any supported font.
.TP
.B \-\-list\-fonts
Like 
.BR \-\-help\-fonts , 
but lists the fonts in a single column to facilitate piping to other
programs.
If no output format is specified with the
.B \-T
option, the full set of supported fonts is listed.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version number of 
.B tek2plot
and the plotting utilities package, and exit.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
The environment variables 
.SB BITMAPSIZE,
.SB PAGESIZE,
.SB BG_COLOR,
.SB EMULATE_COLOR,
.SB MAX_LINE_LENGTH
and
.SB ROTATION
serve as backups for the options 
.BR \-\-bitmap\-size , 
.BR \-\-page\-size ,
.BR \-\-bg\-color , 
.BR \-\-emulate\-color , 
.BR \-\-max\-line\-length ,
and
.BR \-\-rotation ,
respectively.
The remaining environment variables are specific
to individual output formats.
.LP
.BR "tek2plot \-T X" ,
which pops up a window on an X Window System
display and draws graphics in it, checks the 
.SB DISPLAY
environment variable.
Its value determines the display that will be used.
.LP
.BR "tek2plot \-T png"
and
.BR "tek2plot \-T gif" ,
which produce output in PNG format and pseudo-GIF format respectively,
are affected by the 
.SB INTERLACE
environment variable.
If its value is "yes", the output will be interlaced.
Also, if the 
.SB TRANSPARENT_COLOR
environment variable is set to the name of a color, that color will
be treated as transparent in the output.
.LP
.BR "tek2plot \-T pnm" ,
which produces output in portable anymap (PBM/PGM/PPM) format,
is affected by the 
.SB PNM_PORTABLE
environment variable.
If its value is "yes", the output will be in a human-readable format
rather than binary (the default).
.LP
.BR "tek2plot \-T cgm" ,
which produces output in CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) format,
is affected by the 
.SB CGM_MAX_VERSION
and
.SB CGM_ENCODING
environment variables.
By default, it produces a binary-encoded version of CGM version 3 format.
For backward compatibility, the version number may be reduced by setting
.SB CGM_MAX_VERSION
to "2" or "1".
Irrespective of version, the output CGM file will use the human-readable
clear text encoding if 
.SB CGM_ENCODING
is set to "clear_text".
However, only binary-encoded CGM files conform to the WebCGM profile.
.LP
.BR "tek2plot \-T pcl" ,
which produces PCL 5 output for Hewlett\-Packard
printers and plotters, is affected by the environment variable
.SB PCL_ASSIGN_COLORS.
It should be set to "yes" when producing PCL 5 output for a color printer 
or other color device.
This will ensure accurate color reproduction by giving
the output device complete freedom in assigning colors, internally, to
its "logical pens".
If it is "no" then the device will use a fixed set
of colored pens, and will emulate other colors by shading.
The default is "no" because monochrome PCL 5 devices, which are 
much more common
than colored ones, must use shading to emulate color.
.LP
.BR "tek2plot \-T hpgl" ,
which produces Hewlett\-Packard Graphics Language
output, is affected by several environment variables.
The most important is 
.SB HPGL_VERSION,
which may be set to "1", "1.5", or "2"
(the default).
"1" means that the output should be generic HP-GL,
"1.5" means that the output should be suitable for the HP7550A graphics
plotter and the HP758x, HP7595A and HP7596A drafting plotters (HP-GL
with some HP-GL/2 extensions), and "2" means that the output should be
modern HP-GL/2.
If the version is "1" or "1.5" then the only available
fonts will be vector fonts, and all lines will be drawn with a default
width (the 
.B \-W
option will not work).
.LP
The position of the 
.B tek2plot \-T hpgl
graphics display on the page
can be rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise by setting the
.SB HPGL_ROTATE
environment variable to "yes".
This is not the same as the rotation obtained with the 
.B \-\-rotation
option, since it both rotates the graphics display and repositions its
lower left corner toward another corner of the page.  Besides "no" and
"yes", recognized values for 
.SB HPGL_ROTATE
are "0", "90", "180", and "270".  
"no" and "yes" are equivalent to "0" and
"90", respectively.
"180" and "270" are supported only if 
.SB HPGL_VERSION
is "2" (the default).
.LP
By default, 
.B tek2plot \-T hpgl
will draw with a fixed set of pens.
Which pens are present may be specified by setting the
.SB HPGL_PENS
environment variable.
If
.SB HPGL_VERSION
is "1", the default value of
.SB HPGL_PENS
is "1=black"; if
.SB HPGL_VERSION
is "1.5" or "2", the default value of 
.SB HPGL_PENS
is "1=black:2=red:3=green:4=yellow:5=blue:6=magenta:7=cyan".
The format
should be self-explanatory.
By setting
.SB HPGL_PENS
you may specify a
color for any pen in the range #1.\|.\|.#31.
All color names recognized
by the X Window System may be used.
Pen #1 must always be present, though it need not be black.
Any other pen in the range #1.\|.\|.#31 may be omitted.
.LP
If
.SB HPGL_VERSION
is "2" then 
.B tek2plot \-T hpgl
will also be
affected by the environment variable 
.SB HPGL_ASSIGN_COLORS.
If its value is "yes", then 
.B tek2plot \-T hpgl
will not be restricted to the palette specified in 
.SB HPGL_PENS: 
it will assign colors to "logical pens" in the range #1.\|.\|.#31, as needed.
The default value is "no" because other than color LaserJet printers and
DesignJet plotters, not many HP-GL/2 devices allow the assignment of colors
to logical pens.
.LP
The drawing of visible white lines is supported only if
.SB HPGL_VERSION
is "2" and the environment variable 
.SB HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE
is "yes" (the default).
If its value is "no" then white lines (if any), which are normally drawn
with pen #0, will not be drawn.
This feature is to accommodate older HP-GL/2 devices.
HP-GL/2 pen plotters, for example, do not support the use
of pen #0 to draw visible white lines.
Some older HP-GL/2 devices may, in fact,
malfunction if asked to draw opaque objects.
