This directory includes a few files in Tektronix format.  You may use them
to test the `tek2plot' utility, which translates Tektronix files to other
formats, or displays them on an X Window System display.  Another source of
Tektronix files is the SKYMAP astronomical display program (see
http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/skymap ).

In this directory, the file ocpred.tek contains a chart showing an
astronomical event of 1986, prepared in 1985 at the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics.  You may do:

    tek2plot -Tps --font-name HersheyGothicEnglish ocpred.tek > ocpred.ps

to translate it to Postscript.  The text will be rendered in
HersheyGothicEnglish, which is an Old English font.

HersheyGothicEnglish is not a fixed-width font, unlike the original
Tektronix font.  But if you add the `--position-chars' option on the
command line, each character will be positioned individually, so as to
match the position of the corresponding character in the original font.

Similarly, you may do:

    tek2plot -Tps usmap.tek > usmap.ps

to prepare a Postscript version of the USA map.

You would use the `-T X' option, instead of `-T ps', to display the
specified Tektronix file in a popped-up X window.  

To get a list of additional output formats that are supported by
`tek2plot', type `tek2plot --help'.
