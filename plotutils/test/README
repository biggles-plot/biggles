This directory contains the files needed for validation tests of several of
the plot utilities.  The tests are run by doing `make check'.

The `plot2fig' validation test has been observed to fail on MS-DOS and NeXT
machines, due to incorrect formatting of floating-point numbers.  If any of
the other tests should fail, please report it.

HOW THE TESTS ARE DONE

Each .test script generates a .out output file, which is compared with the
corresponding .xout (`expected output') file.  If there are any significant
differences, the test fails.

Most of the generated .out files are translations of the file `graph.xout'
to other graphics formats.  The file `graph.xout' is in the portable
(human-readable) variant of GNU Metafile format.  You may view it in a
popped-up X window, if you are interested, by doing `plot -TX graph.xout'.

SPECIAL FEATURES

The plot2pcl.test script compares the generated output against either
plot2pcl.xout or plot2pcl.yout.  The latter is used if the
`--enable-ps-fonts-in-pcl' option was passed to `configure'.  In that case
a different comparison file is needed, because `--enable-ps-fonts-in-pcl'
allows the output from `plot -Tpcl' to contain any of the 35 PS fonts, such
as Times-Roman.

The comparison performed by plot2hpgl.test is similar.
