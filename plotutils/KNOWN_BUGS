Filling of regions (i.e., the polygonal regions whose vertices are the data
points), when requested by the -q option, works as long as the regions are
entirely within the plotting box.  Filling does not work properly if the
regions extend outside the box, since the clipping algorithm which is used
is appropriate for unfilled regions only.  This will be fixed in a later
release.
