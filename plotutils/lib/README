This directory contains libcommon, a library of miscellaneous support
functions, independent of libplot, which is statically linked with several
of the package executables.  It also contains the file fontlist.c, which is
symlinked at build time into the home directory of any executable that
needs to get font information, such as lists of supported font names, from
libplot.

The reason fontlist.c is not in a library of its own (as it used to be) is
that it accesses internal, undocumented data structures of libplot.  On AIX
systems, it seems libtool can't link the executables with both a
`libfontlist' and libplot, due to some AIX foolishness about libraries not
being allowed to contain undefined symbols.

The functions in libcommon are declared in ../include/libcommon.h, with the
exception of those in getopt.c and getopt1.c, which are declared in
../include/getopt.h.  The functions in fontlist.c are declared in
../include/fontlist.h.
