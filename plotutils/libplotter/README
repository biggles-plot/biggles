This is the build directory for libplotter, the C++ version of libplot.  At
build time, links are set up from here to the source files in ../libplot
and ../libxmi.  The source files are crafted so that they can be compiled
with either a C compiler or a C++ compiler.  In this directory, a C++
compiler is used.
